Moodle Group Quiz Plugin
========================

This is an experimental plugin to demonstrate the feasiblility of group quizzes in moodle.
It relies on api extensions which are *not present in core moodle as of Dec 2014*.

Features:
* Quizzes can be taken in pre-assigned moodle groups with optional (self) attendance.
* Quizzes can be taken in ad-hoc groups in which students specify who is making the shared attempt.
